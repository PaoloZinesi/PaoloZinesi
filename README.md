### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master student in Physics of Data at the University of Padua (IT). This master degree aims at providing students both theoretical and computational tools to be exploited in our data-driven world. Personally, I believe that in the framework in which Big Data techniques integrate physical knowledge, both fields can benefit from this interaction, leading to development and innovation.
